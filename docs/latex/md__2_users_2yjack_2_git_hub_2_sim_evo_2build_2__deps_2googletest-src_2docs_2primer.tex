{\itshape googletest} helps you write better C++ tests.

googletest is a testing framework developed by the Testing Technology team with Google\textquotesingle{}s specific requirements and constraints in mind. Whether you work on Linux, Windows, or a Mac, if you write C++ code, googletest can help you. And it supports {\itshape any} kind of tests, not just unit tests.

So what makes a good test, and how does googletest fit in? We believe\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Tests should be {\itshape independent} and {\itshape repeatable}. It\textquotesingle{}s a pain to debug a test that succeeds or fails as a result of other tests. googletest isolates the tests by running each of them on a different object. When a test fails, googletest allows you to run it in isolation for quick debugging.
\item Tests should be well {\itshape organized} and reflect the structure of the tested code. googletest groups related tests into test suites that can share data and subroutines. This common pattern is easy to recognize and makes tests easy to maintain. Such consistency is especially helpful when people switch projects and start to work on a new code base.
\item Tests should be {\itshape portable} and {\itshape reusable}. Google has a lot of code that is platform-\/neutral; its tests should also be platform-\/neutral. googletest works on different OSes, with different compilers, with or without exceptions, so googletest tests can work with a variety of configurations.
\item When tests fail, they should provide as much {\itshape information} about the problem as possible. googletest doesn\textquotesingle{}t stop at the first test failure. Instead, it only stops the current test and continues with the next. You can also set up tests that report non-\/fatal failures after which the current test continues. Thus, you can detect and fix multiple bugs in a single run-\/edit-\/compile cycle.
\item The testing framework should liberate test writers from housekeeping chores and let them focus on the test {\itshape content}. googletest automatically keeps track of all tests defined, and doesn\textquotesingle{}t require the user to enumerate them in order to run them.
\item Tests should be {\itshape fast}. With googletest, you can reuse shared resources across tests and pay for the set-\/up/tear-\/down only once, without making tests depend on each other.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Since googletest is based on the popular x\+Unit architecture, you\textquotesingle{}ll feel right at home if you\textquotesingle{}ve used JUnit or Py\+Unit before. If not, it will take you about 10 minutes to learn the basics and get started. So let\textquotesingle{}s go!\hypertarget{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md226}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Beware of the nomenclature}{Beware of the nomenclature}}\label{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md226}
\{\+: .callout .note\} {\itshape Note\+:} There might be some confusion arising from different definitions of the terms {\itshape Test}, {\itshape Test Case} and {\itshape Test Suite}, so beware of misunderstanding these.

Historically, googletest started to use the term {\itshape Test Case} for grouping related tests, whereas current publications, including International Software Testing Qualifications Board (\href{http://www.istqb.org/}{\texttt{ ISTQB}}) materials and various textbooks on software quality, use the term {\itshape \href{http://glossary.istqb.org/en/search/test\%20suite}{\texttt{ Test Suite}}} for this.

The related term {\itshape Test}, as it is used in googletest, corresponds to the term {\itshape \href{http://glossary.istqb.org/en/search/test\%20case}{\texttt{ Test Case}}} of ISTQB and others.

The term {\itshape Test} is commonly of broad enough sense, including ISTQB\textquotesingle{}s definition of {\itshape Test Case}, so it\textquotesingle{}s not much of a problem here. But the term {\itshape Test Case} as was used in Google Test is of contradictory sense and thus confusing.

googletest recently started replacing the term {\itshape Test Case} with {\itshape Test Suite}. The preferred API is {\itshape Test\+Suite}. The older Test\+Case API is being slowly deprecated and refactored away.

So please be aware of the different definitions of the terms\+:

When using googletest, you start by writing {\itshape assertions}, which are statements that check whether a condition is true. An assertion\textquotesingle{}s result can be {\itshape success}, {\itshape nonfatal failure}, or {\itshape fatal failure}. If a fatal failure occurs, it aborts the current function; otherwise the program continues normally.

{\itshape Tests} use assertions to verify the tested code\textquotesingle{}s behavior. If a test crashes or has a failed assertion, then it {\itshape fails}; otherwise it {\itshape succeeds}.

A {\itshape test suite} contains one or many tests. You should group your tests into test suites that reflect the structure of the tested code. When multiple tests in a test suite need to share common objects and subroutines, you can put them into a {\itshape test fixture} class.

A {\itshape test program} can contain multiple test suites.

We\textquotesingle{}ll now explain how to write a test program, starting at the individual assertion level and building up to tests and test suites.\hypertarget{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md228}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Assertions}{Assertions}}\label{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md228}
googletest assertions are macros that resemble function calls. You test a class or function by making assertions about its behavior. When an assertion fails, googletest prints the assertion\textquotesingle{}s source file and line number location, along with a failure message. You may also supply a custom failure message which will be appended to googletest\textquotesingle{}s message.

The assertions come in pairs that test the same thing but have different effects on the current function. {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} versions generate fatal failures when they fail, and {\bfseries{abort the current function}}. {\ttfamily EXPECT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} versions generate nonfatal failures, which don\textquotesingle{}t abort the current function. Usually {\ttfamily EXPECT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} are preferred, as they allow more than one failure to be reported in a test. However, you should use {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t make sense to continue when the assertion in question fails.

Since a failed {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} returns from the current function immediately, possibly skipping clean-\/up code that comes after it, it may cause a space leak. Depending on the nature of the leak, it may or may not be worth fixing -\/ so keep this in mind if you get a heap checker error in addition to assertion errors.

To provide a custom failure message, simply stream it into the macro using the {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}} operator or a sequence of such operators. See the following example, using the \href{reference/assertions.md\#EXPECT_EQ}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\+EQ} and {\ttfamily EXPECT\+\_\+\+EQ}}} macros to verify value equality\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{ASSERT\_EQ(x.size(),\ y.size())\ <<\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Vectors\ x\ and\ y\ are\ of\ unequal\ length"{}};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{for}\ (\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ i\ =\ 0;\ i\ <\ x.size();\ ++i)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(x[i],\ y[i])\ <<\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Vectors\ x\ and\ y\ differ\ at\ index\ "{}}\ <<\ i;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Anything that can be streamed to an {\ttfamily ostream} can be streamed to an assertion macro--in particular, C strings and {\ttfamily string} objects. If a wide string ({\ttfamily wchar\+\_\+t\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}}, {\ttfamily TCHAR\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} in {\ttfamily UNICODE} mode on Windows, or {\ttfamily std\+::wstring}) is streamed to an assertion, it will be translated to UTF-\/8 when printed.

Google\+Test provides a collection of assertions for verifying the behavior of your code in various ways. You can check Boolean conditions, compare values based on relational operators, verify string values, floating-\/point values, and much more. There are even assertions that enable you to verify more complex states by providing custom predicates. For the complete list of assertions provided by Google\+Test, see the \doxysectlink{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2reference_2assertions}{Assertions Reference}{0}.\hypertarget{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md229}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Simple Tests}{Simple Tests}}\label{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md229}
To create a test\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Use the {\ttfamily TEST()} macro to define and name a test function. These are ordinary C++ functions that don\textquotesingle{}t return a value.
\item In this function, along with any valid C++ statements you want to include, use the various googletest assertions to check values.
\item The test\textquotesingle{}s result is determined by the assertions; if any assertion in the test fails (either fatally or non-\/fatally), or if the test crashes, the entire test fails. Otherwise, it succeeds.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{TEST(TestSuiteName,\ TestName)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...\ test\ body\ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily TEST()} arguments go from general to specific. The {\itshape first} argument is the name of the test suite, and the {\itshape second} argument is the test\textquotesingle{}s name within the test suite. Both names must be valid C++ identifiers, and they should not contain any underscores ({\ttfamily \+\_\+}). A test\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape full name} consists of its containing test suite and its individual name. Tests from different test suites can have the same individual name.

For example, let\textquotesingle{}s take a simple integer function\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ Factorial(\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ n);\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Returns\ the\ factorial\ of\ n}}

\end{DoxyCode}


A test suite for this function might look like\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Tests\ factorial\ of\ 0.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{TEST(FactorialTest,\ HandlesZeroInput)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(Factorial(0),\ 1);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Tests\ factorial\ of\ positive\ numbers.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{TEST(FactorialTest,\ HandlesPositiveInput)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(Factorial(1),\ 1);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(Factorial(2),\ 2);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(Factorial(3),\ 6);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(Factorial(8),\ 40320);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


googletest groups the test results by test suites, so logically related tests should be in the same test suite; in other words, the first argument to their {\ttfamily TEST()} should be the same. In the above example, we have two tests, {\ttfamily Handles\+Zero\+Input} and {\ttfamily Handles\+Positive\+Input}, that belong to the same test suite {\ttfamily Factorial\+Test}.

When naming your test suites and tests, you should follow the same convention as for \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html\#Function_Names}{\texttt{ naming functions and classes}}.

{\bfseries{Availability}}\+: Linux, Windows, Mac.\hypertarget{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_same-data-multiple-tests}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Test Fixtures\+: Using the Same Data Configuration for Multiple Tests}{Test Fixtures\+: Using the Same Data Configuration for Multiple Tests}}\label{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_same-data-multiple-tests}
If you find yourself writing two or more tests that operate on similar data, you can use a {\itshape test fixture}. This allows you to reuse the same configuration of objects for several different tests.

To create a fixture\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Derive a class from {\ttfamily \doxylink{classtesting_1_1_test}{testing\+::\+Test}} . Start its body with {\ttfamily protected\+:}, as we\textquotesingle{}ll want to access fixture members from sub-\/classes.
\item Inside the class, declare any objects you plan to use.
\item If necessary, write a default constructor or {\ttfamily Set\+Up()} function to prepare the objects for each test. A common mistake is to spell {\ttfamily Set\+Up()} as \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}{\ttfamily Setup()}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} with a small {\ttfamily u} -\/ Use {\ttfamily override} in C++11 to make sure you spelled it correctly.
\item If necessary, write a destructor or {\ttfamily Tear\+Down()} function to release any resources you allocated in {\ttfamily Set\+Up()} . To learn when you should use the constructor/destructor and when you should use {\ttfamily Set\+Up()/\+Tear\+Down()}, read the \href{faq.md\#CtorVsSetUp}{\texttt{ FAQ}}.
\item If needed, define subroutines for your tests to share.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

When using a fixture, use {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+F()} instead of {\ttfamily TEST()} as it allows you to access objects and subroutines in the test fixture\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{TEST\_F(TestFixtureName,\ TestName)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...\ test\ body\ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Like {\ttfamily TEST()}, the first argument is the test suite name, but for {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+F()} this must be the name of the test fixture class. You\textquotesingle{}ve probably guessed\+: {\ttfamily \+\_\+F} is for fixture.

Unfortunately, the C++ macro system does not allow us to create a single macro that can handle both types of tests. Using the wrong macro causes a compiler error.

Also, you must first define a test fixture class before using it in a {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+F()}, or you\textquotesingle{}ll get the compiler error "{}\`{}virtual outside class declaration\`{}"{}.

For each test defined with {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+F()}, googletest will create a {\itshape fresh} test fixture at runtime, immediately initialize it via {\ttfamily Set\+Up()}, run the test, clean up by calling {\ttfamily Tear\+Down()}, and then delete the test fixture. Note that different tests in the same test suite have different test fixture objects, and googletest always deletes a test fixture before it creates the next one. googletest does {\bfseries{not}} reuse the same test fixture for multiple tests. Any changes one test makes to the fixture do not affect other tests.

As an example, let\textquotesingle{}s write tests for a FIFO queue class named {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_queue}{Queue}}, which has the following interface\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{template}\ <\textcolor{keyword}{typename}\ E>\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ E\ is\ the\ element\ type.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }\mbox{\hyperlink{class_queue}{Queue}}\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{keyword}{public}:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{class_queue}{Queue}}();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ Enqueue(\textcolor{keyword}{const}\ E\&\ element);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ E*\ Dequeue();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Returns\ NULL\ if\ the\ queue\ is\ empty.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{keywordtype}{size\_t}\ size()\ \textcolor{keyword}{const};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}


First, define a fixture class. By convention, you should give it the name {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_foo_test}{Foo\+Test}} where {\ttfamily Foo} is the class being tested.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }QueueTest\ :\ \textcolor{keyword}{public}\ \mbox{\hyperlink{classtesting_1_1_test}{::testing::Test}}\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{keyword}{protected}:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ SetUp()\textcolor{keyword}{\ override\ }\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ q1\_.Enqueue(1);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ q2\_.Enqueue(2);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ q2\_.Enqueue(3);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ void\ TearDown()\ override\ \{\}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{class_queue}{Queue<int>}}\ q0\_;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{class_queue}{Queue<int>}}\ q1\_;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{class_queue}{Queue<int>}}\ q2\_;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}


In this case, {\ttfamily Tear\+Down()} is not needed since we don\textquotesingle{}t have to clean up after each test, other than what\textquotesingle{}s already done by the destructor.

Now we\textquotesingle{}ll write tests using {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+F()} and this fixture.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{TEST\_F(QueueTest,\ IsEmptyInitially)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(q0\_.size(),\ 0);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{TEST\_F(QueueTest,\ DequeueWorks)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{keywordtype}{int}*\ n\ =\ q0\_.Dequeue();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(n,\ \textcolor{keyword}{nullptr});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ n\ =\ q1\_.Dequeue();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ASSERT\_NE(n,\ \textcolor{keyword}{nullptr});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(*n,\ 1);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(q1\_.size(),\ 0);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{keyword}{delete}\ n;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ n\ =\ q2\_.Dequeue();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ASSERT\_NE(n,\ \textcolor{keyword}{nullptr});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(*n,\ 2);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ EXPECT\_EQ(q2\_.size(),\ 1);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{keyword}{delete}\ n;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


The above uses both {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} and {\ttfamily EXPECT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} assertions. The rule of thumb is to use {\ttfamily EXPECT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} when you want the test to continue to reveal more errors after the assertion failure, and use {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} when continuing after failure doesn\textquotesingle{}t make sense. For example, the second assertion in the {\ttfamily Dequeue} test is {\ttfamily ASSERT\+\_\+\+NE(n, nullptr)}, as we need to dereference the pointer {\ttfamily n} later, which would lead to a segfault when {\ttfamily n} is {\ttfamily NULL}.

When these tests run, the following happens\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item googletest constructs a {\ttfamily Queue\+Test} object (let\textquotesingle{}s call it {\ttfamily t1}).
\item {\ttfamily t1.\+Set\+Up()} initializes {\ttfamily t1}.
\item The first test ({\ttfamily Is\+Empty\+Initially}) runs on {\ttfamily t1}.
\item {\ttfamily t1.\+Tear\+Down()} cleans up after the test finishes.
\item {\ttfamily t1} is destructed.
\item The above steps are repeated on another {\ttfamily Queue\+Test} object, this time running the {\ttfamily Dequeue\+Works} test.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\ttfamily TEST()} and {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+F()} implicitly register their tests with googletest. So, unlike with many other C++ testing frameworks, you don\textquotesingle{}t have to re-\/list all your defined tests in order to run them.

After defining your tests, you can run them with {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()}, which returns {\ttfamily 0} if all the tests are successful, or {\ttfamily 1} otherwise. Note that {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()} runs {\itshape all tests} in your link unit--they can be from different test suites, or even different source files.

When invoked, the {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()} macro\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Saves the state of all googletest flags.
\item Creates a test fixture object for the first test.
\item Initializes it via {\ttfamily Set\+Up()}.
\item Runs the test on the fixture object.
\item Cleans up the fixture via {\ttfamily Tear\+Down()}.
\item Deletes the fixture.
\item Restores the state of all googletest flags.
\item Repeats the above steps for the next test, until all tests have run.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If a fatal failure happens the subsequent steps will be skipped.

\{\+: .callout .important\} \begin{quote}
IMPORTANT\+: You must {\bfseries{not}} ignore the return value of {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()}, or you will get a compiler error. The rationale for this design is that the automated testing service determines whether a test has passed based on its exit code, not on its stdout/stderr output; thus your {\ttfamily main()} function must return the value of {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()}.

Also, you should call {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()} only {\bfseries{once}}. Calling it more than once conflicts with some advanced googletest features (e.\+g., thread-\/safe \href{advanced.md\#death-tests}{\texttt{ death tests}}) and thus is not supported. \end{quote}

Most users should {\itshape not} need to write their own {\ttfamily main} function and instead link with {\ttfamily gtest\+\_\+main} (as opposed to with {\ttfamily gtest}), which defines a suitable entry point. See the end of this section for details. The remainder of this section should only apply when you need to do something custom before the tests run that cannot be expressed within the framework of fixtures and test suites.

If you write your own {\ttfamily main} function, it should return the value of {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()}.

The {\ttfamily testing\+::\+Init\+Google\+Test()} function parses the command line for googletest flags, and removes all recognized flags. This allows the user to control a test program\textquotesingle{}s behavior via various flags, which we\textquotesingle{}ll cover in the \doxysectlink{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2advanced}{Advanced\+Guide}{0}. You {\bfseries{must}} call this function before calling {\ttfamily RUN\+\_\+\+ALL\+\_\+\+TESTS()}, or the flags won\textquotesingle{}t be properly initialized.

On Windows, {\ttfamily Init\+Google\+Test()} also works with wide strings, so it can be used in programs compiled in {\ttfamily UNICODE} mode as well.

But maybe you think that writing all those {\ttfamily main} functions is too much work? We agree with you completely, and that\textquotesingle{}s why Google Test provides a basic implementation of main(). If it fits your needs, then just link your test with the {\ttfamily gtest\+\_\+main} library and you are good to go.

\{\+: .callout .note\} NOTE\+: {\ttfamily Parse\+GUnit\+Flags()} is deprecated in favor of {\ttfamily Init\+Google\+Test()}.\hypertarget{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md232}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Known Limitations}{Known Limitations}}\label{md__2_users_2yjack_2_git_hub_2_sim_evo_2build_2__deps_2googletest-src_2docs_2primer_autotoc_md232}

\item Google Test is designed to be thread-\/safe. The implementation is thread-\/safe on systems where the {\ttfamily pthreads} library is available. It is currently {\itshape unsafe} to use Google Test assertions from two threads concurrently on other systems (e.\+g. Windows). In most tests this is not an issue as usually the assertions are done in the main thread. If you want to help, you can volunteer to implement the necessary synchronization primitives in {\ttfamily gtest-\/port.\+h} for your platform.
